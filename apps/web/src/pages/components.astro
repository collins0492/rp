            span, leaning on the staff in his left hand, but in his other hand
            Glamdring gleamed, cold and white. His enemy halted again, facing
            him, and the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings. It
            raised the whip, and the thongs whined and cracked. Fire came from
            its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm.</Typography

            'You cannot pass,' he said. The orcs stood still, and a dead silence
            fell. 'I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of
            Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of
            Ud√ªn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass.'

            The Balrog made no answer. The fire in it seemed to die, but the
            darkness grew. It stepped forward slowly onto the bridge, and
            suddenly it drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were
            spread from wall to wall; but still Gandalf could be seen,
            glimmering in the gloom; he seemed small, and altogether alone: grey
            and bent, like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm.

            thongs lashed and curled about the wizard's knees, dragging him to
            the brink. He staggered and fell, grasped vainly at the stone, and
            slid into the abyss. 'Fly, you fools!' he cried, and was gone.</Typography
